Usually heap questions are of sorting

## Representation of Heap ##

Stack / Priority Queue

|      | 
|:----:|

Size => 4

## How to identify problem of Heap? ##

> K should be given

> Smallest or Largest

## Types of Heap ##

### Min Heap ###

> MIN element at the Top of the Priority Queue

GIVEN: K & `Largest` <br/>
THEN: Calculate `MIN` Heap

<hr/>

### Max Heap ###

> MAX element at the Top of the Priority Queue

GIVEN: K & `Smallest` <br/>
THEN: Calculate `MAX` Heap

<hr/>

Time Complexity Improvement
> n (Log n)<sup>2</sup> ----> n (Log K)<sup>2</sup>

<hr/>

>> Unwanted elements are removed from the top of the stack
