> K should be given

> Smallest or Largest

## Types of Heap ##

### Min Heap ###

GIVEN: K & `Largest` <br/>
THEN: Calculate `MIN` Heap

### Max Heap ###

Also known as Priority Queue

GIVEN: K & `Smallest` <br/>
THEN: Calculate `MAX` Heap

Time Complexity is converted from
> n (Log n)<sup>2</sup> ----> n (Log K)<sup>2</sup>
