/**
 * Given weights and values of n items,
 * put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
 * <p>
 * In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1]
 * which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively.
 * <p>
 * Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity,
 * find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W.
 * You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
