# Dynamic Programming - DP #

> `DP` ====> `Recursion` + `Storage`

* DP's parent is Recursion
* Dynamic Programming is also known as Enhanced Recursion

## How to Identify Dynamic Programming Question? ##

> If recursion calls two function then DP can be applied

> Optimal things will be asked

## How to approach problem? ##

> Write recursive code first

> Then Memoize it
