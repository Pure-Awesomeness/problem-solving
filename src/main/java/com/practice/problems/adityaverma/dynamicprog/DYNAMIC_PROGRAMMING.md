## How to Identify Dynamic Programming Question? ##

> If recursion calls two function then DP can be applied 

> Optimal things will be asked

## How to approach problem? ##

> Write recursive code first

> Then Memoize it

## Comparing the Recursion, Recursion + Memoization && Iterative + Memoization Approach

> `Recursive` 

> `Recursive` + `Table`

> `Table`
